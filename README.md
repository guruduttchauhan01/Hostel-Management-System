# Hostel Management System(HMS)
## Project Overview
Welcome to the Hostel Management System (HMS) project! This system is designed to manage various aspects of a hostel, including student information, room allocation, fee management, and more. While the project is currently in an unfinished state, it provides a solid foundation that can be extended and improved for future development.

## Features
+ **Entity Classes:** The project includes entity classes representing key components of a hostel management system. These classes have corresponding getter and setter methods for essential fields.

+ **Hibernate:** The project utilizes Hibernate, a powerful and flexible Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework. Hibernate simplifies the interaction with the database by mapping Java objects to database tables.

+ **Maven:** The project is built and managed using Apache Maven. Maven simplifies the build process, manages dependencies, and facilitates project management.

+ **MySQL Database:** The data for the Hostel Management System is stored in a MySQL database. The database schema is designed to support the basic functionality of the system.

+ **Eclipse IDE:** The project is developed using the Eclipse IDE, a widely-used integrated development environment for Java. The project structure is organized to seamlessly integrate with Eclipse.


## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1) **Clone the Repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/guruduttchauhan01/Hostel-Management-System.git
```

2) **Import Project in Eclipse:**

+ Open Eclipse IDE.
+ Select File -> Import.
+ Choose "Existing Maven Projects" and browse to the project directory.

3) **Configure Database:**

+ Create a MySQL database for the Hostel Management System.
+ Update the **`hibernate.cfg.xml`** file with the appropriate database connection details.

4) **Run the Project:**

+ Execute the **`mvn clean install`** command to build the project.
+ Run the application in Eclipse.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

+ **src/main/java:** Contains the Java source code for the Hostel Management System.
+ **src/main/resources:** Contains configuration files, including Hibernate configuration (**`hibernate.cfg.xml`**).

## Future Improvements
While the current version of the project focuses on managing a single hostel, future enhancements could include:

+ **Multiple Hostel Support:** Extend the system to support multiple hostels.
+ **User Interface:** Develop a user-friendly interface for administrators, staff, and students.
+ **Additional Functionality:** Implement features such as attendance tracking, event management, and more.

##Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram
Here is the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Hostel Management System:

This diagram illustrates the relationships between various entities in the system, such as Students, Rooms, Fees, etc. Use this ERD as a reference to understand the database structure and relationships within the project.

If you need to make changes to the database schema or relationships, ensure that you update the corresponding entity classes and Hibernate configurations accordingly. The ERD serves as a visual guide to the underlying data model of the Hostel Management System.
